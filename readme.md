## Introduction

This repository contains code and exercises from my journey learning Rust. Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Through this journey, I aim to gain a deep understanding of Rust's unique features and best practices.

## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Hello, Cargo!

In this chapter, I learned about Rust's package manager and build system, Cargo. The project is a simple "Hello, world!" application to get familiar with the basics of Cargo commands and project structure.

### Chapter 2: Guessing Game

This chapter covers building a command-line guessing game. This project helped me understand how to handle user input, generate random numbers, and implement basic control flow in Rust.

**Files:**
- `ch2_guessing_game/`
  - `src/main.rs`
  - `Cargo.toml`

## Getting Started

To get started with running the projects in this repository, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. Follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust and Cargo.
